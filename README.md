## ML Task 1 - House Price predciciton using linear regression
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Machine Learning Task-1 of SkillCraftTechnology Internship. 

### Project Overview
The project uses a Linear Regression algorithm for predicting house prices using the plot square footage, no. of bedrooms & bathrooms. The main steps of the project include:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data and
performed necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the dataset to understand key trends, distributions, and relationships between features.
Visualized data using various plots to extract insights.
### Model Selection and Training:

Implemented Linear Regression model to train on the dataset.
### Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the models using metrics such as R-Squared.
Also compared model's performance against other models in kaggle through their competition submissions.
### Prediction and Export:

Used the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
Exported the predictions to a CSV file.
### How to Run

Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).
Download the Colab file or open the file in google colab, load the train.csv and test.csv data in the local directory and run all cells to obtain the results
